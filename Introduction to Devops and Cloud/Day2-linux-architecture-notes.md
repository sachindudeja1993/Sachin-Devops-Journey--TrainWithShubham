## Core Components of Linux
- Kernel → The heart of Linux, manages hardware (CPU, memory, disk, network).
- User Space → Where applications, commands, and libraries run.
- Init/Systemd → First process after boot, starts and manages services.
Quick line: “Kernel controls hardware, User Space runs apps, Systemd manages services.”
## Linux File System Hierarchy
- / → Root directory (everything starts here).
- /bin → Basic commands (ls, cat, cp).
- /etc → Configuration files.
- /home → User directories.
- /var → Logs, variable data.
- /tmp → Temporary files
